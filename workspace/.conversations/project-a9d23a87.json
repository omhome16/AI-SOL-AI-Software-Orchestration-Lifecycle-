The next logical action is to proceed to the architecture design phase. I will delegate this task to the System Architect agent. The runtime exception noted in the context seems to have occurred in a previous, unspecified step and may not be relevant to the architecture phase, but I will keep it in mind if further errors occur. My immediate goal is to get the architecture defined so we can move to development.",

A runtime exception was noted, but with zero files generated, it's unlikely to be from the project's own code and may be a transient issue with the tooling. Therefore, the most logical action is to proceed with the workflow and delegate the architecture design to the System Architect. I need to see the resulting architecture blueprint to ensure this step is successfully completed before moving on to development.",
