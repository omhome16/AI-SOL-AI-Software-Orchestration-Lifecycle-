The design will be clean, intuitive, and focused on driving conversions.\n\n### 3.1 Design Philosophy\n*   **User-Centric:** Every design decision will prioritize the user's needs and ease of use.\n*   **Minimalist Aesthetic:** A clean layout with ample white space to emphasize products and calls-to-action.\n*   **Brand Consistency:** All visual elements will adhere to the established brand guidelines.\n\n### 3.2 Modern Web Patterns to Implement\n*   **Skeleton Screens:** Show a placeholder of the page layout while content is loading to improve perceived performance.\n*   **Lazy Loading:** Images and off-screen content will load only as the user scrolls, saving bandwidth and speeding up initial page load.\n*   **Microinteractions:** Subtle animations and feedback (e.g., button clicks, adding to cart) to make the user experience more engaging.\n*   **Sticky Navigation/Header:** The main navigation and key actions (like cart and search) will remain visible as the user scrolls.\n\n### 3.3 Design Mockups\n> **Note:** The following are placeholders. Visual assets will be developed and attached during the design phase.\n\n#### 3.3.1 Low-Fidelity Wireframes\n*   **Status:** To be created.\n*   **Description:** Basic black-and-white layouts focusing on structure, content hierarchy, and user flow for key pages (Homepage, Product List, Product Detail, Checkout).\n\n#### 3.3.2 High-Fidelity Mockups\n*   **Status:** To be created.\n*   **Description:** Full-color, detailed visual designs that represent the final look and feel of the website, including typography, color palettes, and imagery.\n\n---\n\n## 4.0 Responsive Layouts & Browser Compatibility \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f\ud83d\udcf1\n\nThe website must provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices.\n\n### 4.1 Responsive Breakpoints\nThe layout will adapt seamlessly to the following standard breakpoints:\n*   **Mobile:** < 768px\n*   **Tablet:** 768px - 1024px\n*   **Desktop:** > 1024px\n\n### 4.2 Browser Compatibility\nThe website will be fully functional and visually consistent on the latest two versions of the following browsers:\n\n| Browser | Platform |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Google Chrome | Windows, macOS, Android, iOS |\n| Mozilla Firefox | Windows, macOS |\n| Apple Safari | macOS, iOS |\n| Microsoft Edge | Windows |\n\n---\n\n## 5.0 Accessibility (WCAG) \u267f\n\nWe are committed to making the website accessible to the widest possible audience, including individuals with disabilities.\n\n*   **Compliance Target:** The website will adhere to the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**.\n*   **Key Requirements:**\n    *   **Semantic HTML:** Use of proper HTML5 tags (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc.) to define page structure.\n    *   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements must be fully operable using only a keyboard.\n    *   **ARIA Roles:** Use of Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attributes where necessary to improve screen reader compatibility.\n    *   **Alt Text:** All meaningful images will have descriptive alternative text.\n    *   **Color Contrast:** Text and background colors will meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1.\n    *   **Resizable Text:** Users can resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.\n\n---\n\n## 6.0 Search Engine Optimization (SEO) \ud83d\udcc8\n\nThe website will be built with SEO best practices to ensure high visibility in search engine results.\n\n### 6.1 Technical SEO Requirements\n*   **Clean URLs:** Human-readable and keyword-rich URLs (e.g., `/products/ergonomic-office-chair`).\n*   **Meta Tags:** Unique and descriptive `<title>` and `<meta name=\"description\">` tags for all pages.\n*   **Header Tags:** Proper use of heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to structure content.\n*   **XML Sitemap:** An automatically generated `sitemap.xml` file to help search engines crawl the site.\n*   **`robots.txt`:** A properly configured file to guide search engine bots.\n*   **Schema Markup:** Use of structured data (e.g., Product, Breadcrumb) to enhance search result listings.\n*   **Performance:** Fast page load times are a critical ranking factor (see Performance section below).\n\n---\n\n## 7.0 Non-Functional Requirements \u2699\ufe0f\n\nThese requirements define the quality attributes and operational standards of the system.\n\n| Category | Description & Metrics |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Performance** | The application must be fast and responsive. <br><ul><li>Page load time (LCP) under 2.5 seconds.</li><li>API response time under 200ms for 95% of requests.</li><li>System must handle 1000 concurrent users without degradation.</li></ul> |\n| **Security** | The application must protect all user data and payment information. <br><ul><li>All traffic served over HTTPS.</li><li>Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.</li><li>PCI DSS compliance for payment processing.</li></ul> |\n| **Scalability** | The infrastructure must handle traffic spikes and future growth. <br><ul><li>Stateless application architecture to support load balancing.</li><li>Ability to horizontally scale web and database servers.</li><li>Support for a 50% increase in traffic during sales events.</li></ul> |\n| **Usability** | The application should be intuitive and easy to use. <br><ul><li>Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile.</li><li>WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (as detailed above).</li><li>Clear navigation and a streamlined checkout flow.</li></ul> |\n\n---\n\n## 8.0 Recommended Tech Stack \ud83d\udcbb\n\n| Component | Technology |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Frontend** | React or Vue.js |\n| **Backend** | Node.js (Express) or Python (Django) |\n| **Database** | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis (for caching) |\n| **DevOps & Hosting** | Docker, Kubernetes, AWS or Google Cloud, GitHub Actions (CI/CD) |\n\n---\n\n## 9.0 Project Timeline & Milestones \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f\n\n**Estimated Total Timeline:** 12-16 Weeks\n\n| Phase | Duration (Approx.) | Key Deliverables |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. Discovery & Design** | 3-4 Weeks | Wireframes, High-Fidelity Mockups, Finalized Requirements |\n| **2. Development** | 6-8 Weeks | Coded Frontend, Backend APIs, Database Schema |\n| **3.
