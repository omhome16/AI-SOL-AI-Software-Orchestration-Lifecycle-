Project Overview \ud83c\udfaf\\n\\nThis document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a new To-Do List web application. The primary goal is to create a clean, intuitive, and responsive single-page application (SPA) that allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively. The application will be built using modern web technologies, focusing on a seamless user experience, accessibility, and performance. Data will be persisted locally in the user\\'s browser.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Functional Requirements \ud83d\udccb\\n\\nThe following table details the core features and functionalities of the application.\\n\\n| ID | Feature Description | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| **FR-001** | **Add New Task** | **High** | <ul><li>An input field is displayed on the screen.</li><li>User can type a task description into the input field.</li><li>Pressing an \"Add\" button or the \"Enter\" key adds the task to the list.</li><li>The input field is cleared after the task is added.</li></ul> |\\n| **FR-002** | **Display Task List** | **High** | <ul><li>All added tasks are displayed in a clear, vertical list.</li><li>Each item in the list shows the full task description.</li></ul> |\\n| **FR-003** | **Mark Task as Complete** | **High** | <ul><li>Each task has a checkbox or a similar toggle control.</li><li>Clicking the control marks the task as completed.</li><li>Completed tasks are visually differentiated (e.g., with a strikethrough).</li><li>Completion status persists between sessions.</li></ul> |\\n| **FR-004** | **Edit Existing Task** | **Medium** | <ul><li>An \"Edit\" option is available for each task.</li><li>Activating \"Edit\" allows the user to modify the task\\'s description in-place.</li><li>Saving the changes updates the task in the list.</li></ul> |\\n| **FR-005** | **Remove Task** | **High** | <ul><li>A \"Delete\" option is available for each task.</li><li>Clicking \"Delete\" removes the task from the list permanently.</li></ul> |\\n| **FR-006** | **Data Persistence** | **High** | <ul><li>Tasks are saved to the browser\\'s local storage.</li><li>When the user reloads or re-opens the browser, their tasks are restored to the last saved state.</li></ul> |\\n| **FR-007** | **Responsive Interface** | **High** | <ul><li>The application layout adjusts cleanly for desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.</li><li>All functionality is accessible and usable on smaller screens.</li></ul> |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. UI/UX Design & Mockups \ud83c\udfa8\\n\\nThe application\\'s design should be modern, minimalist, and user-friendly. The focus is on clarity and ease of use, avoiding unnecessary clutter.\\n\\n### 3.1. Visual Style & Branding\\n*   **Color Palette**: A simple, clean palette with a primary accent color for interactive elements (buttons, links, focus states).\\n*   **Typography**: A highly readable, sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Lato, or system UI fonts).\\n*   **Iconography**: Use clear and universally understood icons (e.g., from Font Awesome or Material Icons) for actions like \"Edit\" and \"Delete\".\\n\\n### 3.2. Wireframes & Mockups\\n\\nBelow are conceptual mockups for the primary application views.\\n\\n#### Desktop View\\nThe desktop layout will feature a centered, single-column design for easy focus.', '![Desktop Mockup](https://via.placeholder.com/800x450.png/f0f0f0/333333?text=Desktop+View+-+To-Do+List)', '\\n\\n#### Mobile View\\nThe mobile layout will be optimized for touch interaction, with larger tap targets and a layout that fits vertically on a small screen.', '![Mobile Mockup](https://via.placeholder.com/375x667.png/f0f0f0/333333?text=Mobile+View)', '\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Non-Functional Requirements \u2699\ufe0f\\n\\n### 4.1. Responsive Layouts \ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcbb\\nThe application must implement a fluid, mobile-first responsive design.\\n*   **Breakpoints**: The layout must adapt gracefully at standard breakpoints for mobile (<768px), tablet (768px - 1024px), and desktop (>1024px).\\n*   **Content Flow**: Content should reflow naturally without horizontal scrolling.\\n*   **Interaction**: Touch targets on mobile devices must be at least 44x44 pixels.\\n\\n### 4.2. Browser Compatibility \ud83c\udf10\\nThe application must be fully functional and render consistently across the latest versions of major web browsers.\\n\\n| Browser | Supported Versions |\\n| :--- | :--- |\\n| Google Chrome | Latest 2 versions |\\n| Mozilla Firefox | Latest 2 versions |\\n| Microsoft Edge | Latest 2 versions |\\n| Apple Safari | Latest 2 versions |\\n\\n### 4.3. Accessibility (A11y) \u267f\\nThe application must be accessible to users with disabilities and conform to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** guidelines.\\n*   **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<button>`, `<input>`) to define page structure.\\n*   **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links) must be focusable and operable using only a keyboard.\\n*   **Screen Reader Support**: Use ARIA attributes where necessary to provide context to screen reader users (e.g., `aria-label` for icon-only buttons).\\n*   **Color Contrast**: Text and background colors must meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1.\\n\\n### 4.4. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) \ud83d\udd0d\\nBasic on-page SEO practices must be implemented to ensure the site is indexable.\\n*   **Title & Meta Tags**: The `<title>` and `<meta name=\"description\">` tags should be descriptive and relevant.\\n*   **Crawlability**: Ensure no `robots.txt` or meta tags block search engine crawlers.\\n*   **Semantic Markup**: Use header tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) to structure content logically.\\n\\n### 4.5. Performance \u2705\\nThe application must be fast and responsive to user input.\\n*   **Load Time**: Initial page load (First Contentful Paint) should be under **2 seconds**.\\n*   **Interaction Speed**: UI response to user actions (add, edit, delete) should feel instantaneous (under **200ms**).\\n*   **Asset Optimization**: Minify CSS and JavaScript files. Optimize any images to reduce file size.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. Technical Stack \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\\n\\n| Category | Technology | Notes |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+) | No framework required for this version. |\\n| **Data Storage** | Browser Local Storage | For client-side persistence of tasks. |\\n| **DevOps** | Git, GitHub | For version control. |\\n| **Hosting** | Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages | For easy deployment of a static site. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6. Risks & Assumptions\\n\\n### 6.1. Risks\\n*   **Data Loss**: Data is stored in local storage and can be lost if a user clears their browser cache or switches devices.\\n*   **Scope Creep**: Requests for features like user accounts, cloud sync, or collaboration are out of scope and would significantly increase complexity.\\n*   **Browser Inconsistencies**: Minor visual bugs may arise due to differences in browser rendering engines.\\n\\n### 6.2. Assumptions\\n*   The initial version will not have a backend or user authentication.\\n*   The design will be simple and functional, without complex animations.\\n*   All necessary graphical assets (icons, logos) will be provided or sourced from open-source libraries.']\n",
