    "Of course. I am the Master Orchestrator for AI-SOL, and I am ready to guide you through the creation of your \"Basic To-Do List Website.\" I will ensure complete transparency at every step of our journey.\n\nLet's begin.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Current Stage**: Project Initiation\n\ud83d\udccb **Action**: I will now acknowledge and analyze your initial project request. My goal is to summarize my understanding of the requirements, outline the high-level plan, and ask a critical clarifying question to define the project's scope before we proceed.\n\ud83d\udca1 **Reasoning**: Establishing a clear, shared understanding from the very beginning is the most important step. The decision we make on the primary clarifying question will fundamentally shape the architecture and complexity of the entire project. This ensures we build exactly what you need, efficiently.\n\u2728 **Expected Outcome**: We will have a confirmed project direction, allowing us to confidently move into the formal **Requirements** gathering stage.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Your Request\n\nBased on the document you provided, here is my understanding of the project:\n\n*   **Core Functionality**: You need a web application to manage a to-do list. The essential features are creating, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as complete.\n*   **Key User Experience (UX) Features**: The interface must be responsive (working on desktop and mobile), intuitive, and provide advanced features like task reordering (drag-and-drop) and categorization/prioritization.\n*   **Technical Foundation**: The front-end will be built with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The method for saving tasks is a key decision point.\n\n### The AI-SOL Workflow Plan\n\nI will guide you through the following five stages to bring this project to life:\n1.  **Requirements**: We will flesh out the initial request into a detailed specification.\n2.  **Architecture**: I will design the system, choose the tech stack, and define the file structure.\n3.  **Implementation**: I will generate all the necessary code.\n4.  **QA**: I will create and run tests to ensure the application works as expected.\n5.  **DevOps**: I will set up the necessary configurations for deployment.\n\n### Clarifying Question\n\nYour requirements mention an \"**optional backend** for user authentication and task storage.\" This is the most important decision we need to make right now.\n\nPlease choose one of the following paths:\n\n*   **Option A: Simple, Browser-Based App**: We build a front-end-only application. All tasks will be saved directly in the user's browser using **Local Storage**.\n    *   **Pros**: Faster to develop, simpler, works offline.\n    *   **Cons**: Tasks are tied to a single browser on a single device and cannot be accessed elsewhere.\n\n*   **Option B: Full-Stack App with a Backend**: We design and build a complete application with a backend server, a database, and user accounts.\n    *   **Pros**: Users can log in and access their to-do lists from any device. Data is securely stored.\n    *   **Cons**: More complex and time-consuming to build.\n\nWhich option would you like to proceed with? Your answer will determine our next steps in the **Requirements** stage.",
