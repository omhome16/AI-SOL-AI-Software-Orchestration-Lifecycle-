    "explanation": "This architecture outlines a simple web-based game using a modern, decoupled technology stack. The frontend is a single-page application built with React (using Vite for tooling), providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. The backend is a high-performance REST API built with Python and FastAPI, which handles all game logic, user authentication, and data persistence. Communication between the client and server is done via JSON over HTTP. Authentication is managed using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). A SQLite database is used for simplicity and ease of setup, with SQLAlchemy as the ORM for data modeling and interaction. The entire system is designed to be containerized with Docker for consistent development and deployment.",
