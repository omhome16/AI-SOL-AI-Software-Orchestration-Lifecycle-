['# Web Development Requirements Document\n**Project**: To-Do List Web Application  \n**Version**: 1.0  \n**Date**: October 26, 2023\n\n---\n\n## 1.0 Project Overview 📝\n\nThis document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a modern, responsive To-Do List web application. The primary goal is to create an intuitive, accessible, and performant single-page application (SPA) that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. The application will prioritize a clean user interface, seamless user experience, and robust performance across all modern devices and browsers.\n\n---\n\n## 2.0 UI/UX Design Principles 🎨\n\nThe design will be minimalistic, clean, and focused on usability. The user experience should be intuitive, requiring no prior training.\n\n*   **Clarity & Simplicity**: The interface will be uncluttered, with a clear visual hierarchy. Core actions (add, complete, delete) will be immediately obvious.\n*   **Feedback**: The application will provide immediate visual feedback for user actions, such as adding a task, marking it complete, or encountering an error.\n*   **Modern Patterns**: We will leverage established web patterns to enhance usability:\n    *   **In-place Editing**: Users can edit tasks directly within the list without navigating to a new page.\n    *   **Drag-and-Drop**: Users can reorder tasks to reflect their priority.\n    *   **Minimalist Forms**: A single input field for adding new tasks to reduce friction.\n\n### 2.1 Design Mockups & Wireframes\n\n*This section will be populated with visual mockups and wireframes during the design phase. Placeholders are included below for reference.*\n\n#### 2.1.1 Desktop View ( > 1024px)\n*(Link to Figma/Sketch/Adobe XD mockup will be inserted here)*', '![Desktop Mockup Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/800x450.png?text=Desktop+View)', '\n\n#### 2.1.2 Tablet View ( > 768px)\n*(Link to Figma/Sketch/Adobe XD mockup will be inserted here)*', '![Tablet Mockup Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Tablet+View)', '\n\n#### 2.1.3 Mobile View ( < 768px)\n*(Link to Figma/Sketch/Adobe XD mockup will be inserted here)*', '![Mobile Mockup Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/375x667.png?text=Mobile+View)', '\n\n---\n\n## 3.0 Technical Requirements 💻\n\nThis section details the core technical specifications, including responsiveness, browser support, accessibility, and SEO.\n\n### 3.1 Responsive Layouts 📱\n\nThe application must be fully responsive and provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.\n\n| Breakpoint      | Screen Width      | Layout Adjustments                               |\n| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Mobile**      | 320px - 767px     | Single-column layout, touch-friendly controls.   |\n| **Tablet**      | 768px - 1023px    | Single-column with increased spacing and margins. |\n| **Desktop**     | 1024px and above  | Centered, max-width container for readability.   |\n\n### 3.2 Browser Compatibility 🌐\n\nThe application must be fully functional and visually consistent on the latest two versions of the following browsers:\n\n*   ✅ Google Chrome\n*   ✅ Mozilla Firefox\n*   ✅ Apple Safari\n*   ✅ Microsoft Edge\n\n### 3.3 Accessibility (A11y) ♿\n\nThe application must be accessible to users with disabilities and comply with **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards.\n\n*   **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links) must be focusable and operable via the keyboard.\n*   **Screen Reader Support**: Use semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<button>`, `<input>`) and ARIA attributes where necessary to ensure compatibility with screen readers like NVDA and VoiceOver.\n*   **Color Contrast**: Text and background color combinations must meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1.\n*   **Focus Management**: Logical focus order must be maintained throughout the application.\n\n### 3.4 Search Engine Optimization (SEO) 🚀\n\nWhile this is an application, foundational SEO best practices will be implemented for discoverability.\n\n*   **Meta Tags**: A relevant `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` will be included.\n*   **Semantic HTML**: The document structure will use semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) to provide context to search engines.\n*   **Performance**: Fast load times will be prioritized, as this is a key ranking factor. (See Performance NFR).\n\n---\n\n## 4.0 Functional Requirements\n\nThe following table lists the core features of the application.\n\n| ID      | Feature Description                               | Priority | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                             |\n| :------ | :------------------------------------------------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| FR-001  | User can add a new task                           | **High** | - An input field is present at the top of the page.<br>- Pressing \'Enter\' or clicking an \'Add\' button adds the task to the list.<br>- The input field is cleared after adding.     |\n| FR-002  | User can view all tasks                           | **High** | - All tasks are displayed in a vertical list.<br>- Each task shows its description and a checkbox.<br>- Completed tasks are visually distinct (e.g., strikethrough).             |\n| FR-003  | User can mark a task as complete/incomplete       | **High** | - Each task has a clickable checkbox.<br>- Clicking the checkbox toggles the task\'s completion state.<br>- The visual style of the task updates immediately.                     |\n| FR-004  | User can edit an existing task                    | **Medium** | - An \'edit\' icon is visible for each task.<br>- Clicking \'edit\' makes the task description an editable field.<br>- Saving the edit updates the task in the list.                  |\n| FR-005  | User can delete a task                            | **High** | - A \'delete\' icon is visible for each task.<br>- Clicking \'delete\' prompts for confirmation.<br>- Upon confirmation, the task is permanently removed from the list.              |\n| FR-006  | User can reorder tasks                            | **Medium** | - Tasks can be reordered via drag-and-drop interaction.<br>- The new order is saved and persists.                                                                               |\n| FR-007  | Application state is persistent                   | **High** | - All tasks, their status, and order are saved to the browser\'s Local Storage.<br>- The task list is restored when the user reopens the browser.                               |\n\n---\n\n## 5.0 Non-Functional Requirements\n\nThese requirements define the quality attributes and constraints of the system.\n\n| Category        | Requirement                                                                   | Success Metric                                                                                               |\n| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Performance** | The application must load quickly and feel responsive.                        | - Initial page load (First Contentful Paint) under 2 seconds.<br>- UI interactions respond in under 200ms. |\n| **Usability**   | The interface must be intuitive and easy to use for non-technical users.      | - Core actions (add, complete, delete) are achievable in 2 clicks or less.<br>- No user training required. |\n| **Security**    | Data is stored locally; no sensitive data is transmitted.                     | - No use of cookies for tracking.<br>- All code is client-side.                                              |\n| **Scalability** | The application should handle a list of 100+ tasks without performance degradation. | - Adding/editing/deleting tasks in a large list remains under the 200ms response time metric.             |']
