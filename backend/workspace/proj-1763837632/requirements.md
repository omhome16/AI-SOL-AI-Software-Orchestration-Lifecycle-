["# Web Development Requirements Document\n**Project**: Simple To-Do List Web Application\n**Version**: 1.0\n**Date**: October 26, 2023\n\n---\n\n## 1. Project Overview 📝\n\nThis document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a new To-Do List web application. The primary goal is to create a clean, intuitive, and responsive single-page application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. The application will be client-side only, utilizing browser local storage for data persistence. The focus is on a high-quality user experience, accessibility, and modern web standards.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Functional Requirements 📋\n\nThe following table details the core features and user stories for the application.\n\n| ID | User Story / Description | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| FR-001 | As a user, I want to add new tasks to my to-do list so I can track my responsibilities. | **High** | - An input field is present to enter task descriptions.<br>- Clicking an 'Add' button or pressing 'Enter' adds the new task.<br>- The input field is cleared after a task is added. |\n| FR-002 | As a user, I want to view all my tasks in a list so I can see what needs to be done. | **High** | - All added tasks are displayed in a clear, vertical list.<br>- Each task in the list shows its full description. |\n| FR-003 | As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete to track my progress. | **High** | - Each task has a checkbox.<br>- Clicking the checkbox marks the task as complete with a visual change (e.g., strikethrough).<br>- Clicking again reverts the task to incomplete. |\n| FR-004 | As a user, I want to edit the description of an existing task to correct or update it. | **Medium** | - An 'Edit' button/icon is available for each task.<br>- Clicking 'Edit' allows in-place modification of the task's description.<br>- Changes are saved upon confirmation (e.g., pressing 'Enter'). |\n| FR-005 | As a user, I want to delete tasks that are no longer needed. | **Medium** | - A 'Delete' button/icon is available for each task.<br>- Clicking 'Delete' permanently removes the task from the list. |\n| FR-006 | As a user, I want my tasks to be saved so I don't lose them when I refresh or close the page. | **High** | - Tasks and their completion status are preserved after a browser refresh or restart.<br>- Data is stored using the browser's Local Storage. |\n| FR-007 | As a user, I want the website to be responsive so I can use it on both my desktop and mobile devices. | **High** | - The layout adjusts gracefully to fit various screen sizes.<br>- All functionality is accessible on smaller screens without horizontal scrolling. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Non-Functional Requirements ⚙️\n\n### 3.1 UI/UX Design 🎨\n\nThe application's design should be modern, clean, and intuitive. The user interface must be simple enough for a new user to understand and use all core features within 60 seconds without instructions.\n\n*   **Clarity**: All interactive elements (buttons, inputs) must be clearly identifiable.\n*   **Feedback**: The system must provide immediate visual feedback for user actions like adding, completing, or deleting a task.\n*   **Consistency**: The design language (colors, fonts, spacing) must be consistent throughout the application.\n*   **Modern Patterns**:\n    *   **In-place Editing**: Users can edit tasks directly in the list view without navigating to a new page.\n    *   **Minimalist Interface**: Avoid clutter. The focus should be on the task list itself.\n    *   **Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs)**: The primary action (adding a task) should be prominent.\n\n### 3.2 Design Mockups 🖼️\n\nThis section will be updated with visual guides once they are created.\n\n#### Low-Fidelity Wireframes\n*Placeholder for low-fidelity wireframes showing basic layout and element placement for mobile and desktop views.*", '![Low-Fidelity Wireframe](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Low-Fidelity+Wireframe)', '\n\n#### High-Fidelity Mockups\n*Placeholder for high-fidelity mockups showing the final visual design, including color palette, typography, and iconography.*', '![High-Fidelity Mockup](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=High-Fidelity+Mockup)', '\n\n### 3.3 Responsive Layouts 📱💻\n\nThe application must provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices.\n\n| Device Class | Viewport Width | Layout Requirements |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Mobile** | < 768px | - Single-column layout.<br>- Touch-friendly button sizes.<br>- Legible font sizes. |\n| **Tablet** | 768px - 1024px | - Single or two-column layout.<br>- Optimized spacing for a wider view. |\n| **Desktop** | > 1024px | - Centered, fixed-width container for the main content.<br>- Utilizes whitespace effectively. |\n\n### 3.4 Browser Compatibility 🌐\n\nThe application must be fully functional and render correctly on the latest two versions of all major web browsers.\n\n*   ✅ Google Chrome\n*   ✅ Mozilla Firefox\n*   ✅ Microsoft Edge\n*   ✅ Apple Safari\n\n### 3.5 Accessibility (A11y) ♿\n\nThe application must be accessible to people with disabilities and conform to **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**.\n\n*   **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML5 tags (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<button>`, etc.) to define the page structure.\n*   **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements must be focusable and operable using only a keyboard. The focus order must be logical.\n*   **Screen Reader Support**: Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where necessary to provide context to screen reader users (e.g., `aria-label` for icon-only buttons).\n*   **Color Contrast**: Text and background colors must meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1.\n*   **Alt Text**: All meaningful images must have descriptive alternative text.\n\n### 3.6 Search Engine Optimization (SEO) 📈\n\nBasic on-page SEO principles will be implemented to ensure the site is indexable and discoverable.\n\n*   **Title Tag**: The `<title>` tag will be descriptive and relevant (e.g., "My To-Do List | A Simple Task Manager").\n*   **Meta Description**: A concise and relevant meta description will be provided.\n*   **Semantic Markup**: Use of header tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to create a logical document outline.\n\n### 3.7 Performance 🚀\n\nThe application must be fast and responsive to user input.\n\n*   **Initial Page Load**: The page should be interactive in **under 2 seconds** on a standard 4G connection.\n*   **UI Responsiveness**: All user actions (add, complete, delete) should provide feedback in **under 200ms**.\n*   **Asset Optimization**: CSS and JavaScript files will be minified to reduce file size.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Technical Specifications & Scope\n\n### 4.1 Recommended Tech Stack\n\n| Category | Technology |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+) |\n| **Database** | Browser Local Storage |\n| **DevOps** | Git, GitHub, Netlify/Vercel for deployment |\n\n### 4.2 Assumptions\n\n*   The application is for single-user, client-side use only.\n*   No user authentication or cloud synchronization is required for this version.\n*   The visual design will prioritize simplicity and functionality.\n\n### 4.3 Risks\n\n| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Data Loss** | Since data is in local storage, users will lose tasks if they clear their browser cache. This limitation will be communicated to the user. |\n| **Scope Creep** | Requests for features like user accounts or cloud sync will be deferred to a future version (v2.0). |\n| **Browser Inconsistencies** | Rigorous testing across all target browsers will be conducted to identify and fix any CSS or JavaScript compatibility issues. |\n\n### 4.4 Estimated Timeline\n\n*   **Total Estimated Effort**: 20-30 hours']
