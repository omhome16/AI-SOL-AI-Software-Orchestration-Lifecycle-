# Domain Analysis: general

## Domain Overview
This project falls under the **general** domain with **web_application** architecture.

## Domain-Specific Considerations
- **Industry Standards:** general industry best practices
- **Compliance Requirements:** Domain-specific regulatory requirements
- **User Expectations:** general user experience patterns

## Technology Recommendations
Based on general domain expertise:
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js (proven in general)
- **Frontend:** React.js, CSS3 (suitable for general users)
- **Database:** Local Storage (Browser), PostgreSQL (for future expansion) (scales for general data)

## Domain-Specific Risks
- Scope Creep: The simplicity of the project may lead to requests for additional features like user accounts, cloud sync, or collaboration, which are outside the initial scope.
- Data Loss: Since the primary data store is browser Local Storage, users can accidentally lose all their data by clearing their browser cache.
- Design Subjectivity: The requirement for a "minimal and aesthetic" frontend can be subjective, potentially leading to multiple design revisions.
- Cross-Browser Compatibility: Minor CSS or JavaScript inconsistencies across different web browsers could affect the user experience.

## Domain Assumptions
- User authentication (login/logout) is not required for the initial version.
- The application will be a Single Page Application (SPA) for a seamless user experience.
- Initial persistent storage will be implemented using the browser's Local Storage, meaning tasks are stored on the user's device.
- The application is intended for individual use; real-time collaboration features are not in scope.
- The developer has foundational knowledge of the recommended JavaScript-based technology stack.
