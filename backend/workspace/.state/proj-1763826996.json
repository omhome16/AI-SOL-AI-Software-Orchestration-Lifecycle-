Non-Functional Requirements \u2699\ufe0f\\n\\nThis section covers the quality attributes and technical standards the application must adhere to.\\n\\n### 3.1 UI/UX Design \ud83c\udfa8\\n\\nThe user interface must be clean, modern, and intuitive. The design should prioritize ease of use, enabling a new user to understand all core functionalities within one minute without instructions.\\n\\n*   **Visual Hierarchy**: Important elements like the task input field and the task list should be prominent.\\n*   **Feedback**: The application must provide immediate visual feedback for user actions (e.g., adding, completing, deleting a task).\\n*   **Minimalism**: Avoid clutter. The interface should focus solely on task management.\\n*   **Modern Patterns**: Implement a single-page application (SPA) feel for instant updates without page reloads.\\n\\n#### Design Mockups\\n\\n*Placeholder for UI/UX mockups. Links to Figma, Sketch, or image files will be inserted here.*\\n\\n*   **Mobile View Mockup:** `[Link to Mobile Mockup]`\\n*   **Desktop View Mockup:** `[Link to Desktop Mockup]`\\n\\n### 3.2 Responsive Layouts \ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcbb\\n\\nThe application must provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices. The layout will be fluid and adapt to different screen sizes.\\n\\n| Device Class | Screen Width Breakpoints | Notes |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| **Mobile** | 320px - 767px | Single-column layout, touch-friendly controls. |\\n| **Tablet** | 768px - 1023px | Enhanced single-column or two-column layout. |\\n| **Desktop** | 1024px and above | Full-width layout, optimized for mouse and keyboard. |\\n\\n### 3.3 Browser Compatibility \ud83c\udf10\\n\\nThe application must be fully functional and render correctly on the latest two major versions of the following browsers:\\n\\n*   Google Chrome\\n*   Mozilla Firefox\\n*   Apple Safari\\n*   Microsoft Edge\\n\\n### 3.4 Accessibility (A11y) \u267f\\n\\nThe application must be accessible to people with disabilities and comply with **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**.\\n\\n*   **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links) must be focusable and operable using only a keyboard.\\n*   **Screen Reader Support**: Use semantic HTML (e.g., `<main>`, `<button>`, `<input>`) and ARIA attributes where necessary to ensure compatibility with screen readers like NVDA and VoiceOver.\\n*   **Color Contrast**: Text and background colors must meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1.\\n*   **Focus Management**: Visual focus indicators must be clear and visible.\\n\\n### 3.5 Search Engine Optimization (SEO) \ud83d\udd0d\\n\\nBasic on-page SEO practices will be implemented to ensure the application is discoverable.\\n\\n*   **Title Tags**: The main page will have a descriptive `<title>` tag (e.g., \"TaskMaster - Your Simple To-Do List\").\\n*   **Meta Descriptions**: A concise and relevant meta description will be provided.\\n*   **Semantic HTML**: The page structure will use semantic tags (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<h1>`) to provide context to search engines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Technical Specifications \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n### 4.1 Recommended Tech Stack\\n\\n| Category | Technology | Purpose |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+) | Core web technologies for building the user interface. |\\n| **Database** | Browser Local Storage | Client-side persistence of user tasks. |\\n| **DevOps** | Git, GitHub | Version control and repository hosting. |\\n| **Deployment** | Netlify / Vercel | Continuous deployment and hosting. |\\n\\n### 4.2 Project Structure\\n\\nA simple and maintainable project structure will be used.\\n\\n```\\n/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 style.css\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 script.js\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 assets/\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 images/\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 icons/\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. Project Management \u23f3\\n\\n### 5.1 Estimated Timeline\\nThe initial development is estimated to take **20-30 developer hours**.\\n\\n### 5.2 Risks\\n\\n*   **Scope Creep**: Adding features beyond the initial requirements (e.g., user accounts, cloud sync) could significantly increase complexity and delay the project.\\n*   **Data Loss**: As data is stored in Local Storage, users may lose all their tasks if they clear their browser data. This limitation should be communicated to the user.\\n*   **Browser Inconsistencies**: Minor differences in CSS/JavaScript implementation across browsers may require specific fixes.\\n\\n### 5.3 Assumptions\\n\\n*   User authentication and a backend server are not required for this version.\\n*   The application is for a single user on a single browser instance.\\n*   The design will be simple and functional, prioritizing usability over complex aesthetics.\\n', 'auto_focus': True, 'timestamp': '2025-11-22T21:27:28.212684'}",

The layout will be fluid and adapt to different screen sizes.\n\n| Device Class | Screen Width Breakpoints | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Mobile** | 320px - 767px | Single-column layout, touch-friendly controls. |\n| **Tablet** | 768px - 1023px | Enhanced single-column or two-column layout. |\n| **Desktop** | 1024px and above | Full-width layout, optimized for mouse and keyboard. |\n\n### 3.3 Browser Compatibility \ud83c\udf10\n\nThe application must be fully functional and render correctly on the latest two major versions of the following browsers:\n\n*   Google Chrome\n*   Mozilla Firefox\n*   Apple Safari\n*   Microsoft Edge\n\n### 3.4 Accessibility (A11y) \u267f\n\nThe application must be accessible to people with disabilities and comply with **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**.\n\n*   **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links) must be focusable and operable using only a keyboard.\n*   **Screen Reader Support**: Use semantic HTML (e.g., `<main>`, `<button>`, `<input>`) and ARIA attributes where necessary to ensure compatibility with screen readers like NVDA and VoiceOver.\n*   **Color Contrast**: Text and background colors must meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1.\n*   **Focus Management**: Visual focus indicators must be clear and visible.\n\n### 3.5 Search Engine Optimization (SEO) \ud83d\udd0d\n\nBasic on-page SEO practices will be implemented to ensure the application is discoverable.\n\n*   **Title Tags**: The main page will have a descriptive `<title>` tag (e.g., \"TaskMaster - Your Simple To-Do List\").\n*   **Meta Descriptions**: A concise and relevant meta description will be provided.\n*   **Semantic HTML**: The page structure will use semantic tags (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<h1>`) to provide context to search engines.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Technical Specifications \ud83d\ude80\n\n### 4.1 Recommended Tech Stack\n\n| Category | Technology | Purpose |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+) | Core web technologies for building the user interface. |\n| **Database** | Browser Local Storage | Client-side persistence of user tasks. |\n| **DevOps** | Git, GitHub | Version control and repository hosting. |\n| **Deployment** | Netlify / Vercel | Continuous deployment and hosting. |\n\n### 4.2 Project Structure\n\nA simple and maintainable project structure will be used.\n\n```\n/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 style.css\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 script.js\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 assets/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 images/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 icons/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Project Management \u23f3\n\n### 5.1 Estimated Timeline\nThe initial development is estimated to take **20-30 developer hours**.\n\n### 5.2 Risks\n\n*   **Scope Creep**: Adding features beyond the initial requirements (e.g., user accounts, cloud sync) could significantly increase complexity and delay the project.\n*   **Data Loss**: As data is stored in Local Storage, users may lose all their tasks if they clear their browser data. This limitation should be communicated to the user.\n*   **Browser Inconsistencies**: Minor differences in CSS/JavaScript implementation across browsers may require specific fixes.\n\n### 5.3 Assumptions\n\n*   User authentication and a backend server are not required for this version.\n*   The application is for a single user on a single browser instance.\n*   The design will be simple and functional, prioritizing usability over complex aesthetics.\n",
