\ud83c\udfa8\\n\\nThe design will be clean, modern, and user-centric, focusing on driving conversions and building brand trust.\\n\\n### 4.1 Design Principles & Patterns\\n*   **Minimalist Aesthetic**: A clean layout with ample white space to emphasize products.\\n*   **Intuitive Navigation**: A clear, sticky header with logical categories and a prominent search bar.\\n*   **Visual Hierarchy**: Use of size, color, and placement to guide user attention to key elements like \"Add to Cart\" buttons.\\n*   **Microinteractions**: Subtle animations and feedback (e.g., button clicks, loading spinners) to enhance the user experience.\\n*   **Single-Page Checkout**: A streamlined checkout process to reduce cart abandonment.\\n\\n### 4.2 Low-Fidelity Wireframes\\n*(This section will be populated with wireframe images for key pages like Homepage, Product Listing, Product Detail, and Checkout Flow once created.)*\\n\\n`[Placeholder for Homepage Wireframe]`\\n`[Placeholder for Product Listing Page Wireframe]`\\n`[Placeholder for Checkout Flow Wireframe]`\\n\\n### 4.3 High-Fidelity Mockups & Style Guide\\n*(This section will be populated with high-fidelity, full-color mockups and a comprehensive style guide including typography, color palette, and component designs.)*\\n\\n`[Placeholder for High-Fidelity Homepage Mockup]`\\n`[Placeholder for Component Library / Style Guide]`\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5.0 Responsive Layouts \ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcbb\\n\\nThe website will be built using a **mobile-first** approach to ensure a seamless experience on all screen sizes.\\n\\n| Device Category | Viewport Breakpoint (Approx.) | Key Considerations |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| **Mobile** | 320px - 767px | \u2022 Single-column layout.<br>\u2022 Thumb-friendly navigation (hamburger menu).<br>\u2022 Optimized images for fast loading. |\\n| **Tablet** | 768px - 1024px | \u2022 Two or three-column grid for products.<br>\u2022 Touch-friendly carousels and controls.<br>\u2022 Full navigation may be visible. |\\n| **Desktop** | 1025px and above | \u2022 Multi-column layouts.<br>\u2022 Hover effects for interactivity.<br>\u2022 Full use of screen real estate for rich content. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6.0 Browser Compatibility \ud83c\udf10\\n\\nThe website must be fully functional and render correctly on the latest versions of all major web browsers.\\n\\n| Browser | Version Support |\\n| :--- | :--- |\\n| **Google Chrome** | Latest 2 versions |\\n| **Mozilla Firefox** | Latest 2 versions |\\n| **Apple Safari** | Latest 2 versions |\\n| **Microsoft Edge** | Latest 2 versions |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7.0 Accessibility (WCAG) \u267f\\n\\nThe website will be developed to meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.\\n\\n*   **Perceivable**: All content must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive (e.g., alt text for all images).\\n*   **Operable**: The interface must be fully navigable via keyboard.\\n*   **Understandable**: Content and operation must be clear and predictable.\\n*   **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8.0 Search Engine Optimization (SEO) \ud83d\udd0d\\n\\nThe site will be built with on-page SEO best practices to ensure maximum visibility on search engines like Google.\\n\\n| SEO Requirement | Description |\\n| :--- | :--- |\\n| **Semantic HTML** | Use of proper HTML5 tags (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, etc.) to provide context to search engines. |\\n| **Meta Tags** | Unique and descriptive `title` and `meta description` tags for all pages. |\\n| **URL Structure** | Clean, human-readable, and keyword-rich URLs (e.g., `/products/cool-gadget-v1`). |\\n| **Schema Markup** | Implementation of structured data (e.g., Product, Review schemas) for rich snippets. |\\n| **Sitemap & Robots.txt** | An auto-generated `sitemap.xml` and a properly configured `robots.txt` file. |\\n| **Image Optimization** | All images will be compressed and include descriptive `alt` text. |\\n| **Core Web Vitals** | The site will be optimized to pass Google\\'s Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS). |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 9.0 Assumptions & Risks\\n\\n### 9.1 Assumptions\\n*   Product data (images, descriptions, pricing) will be provided by the client.\\n*   Third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) will be used.\\n*   Shipping and tax calculation logic will be based on third-party APIs or predefined rules.\\n\\n### 9.2 Risks\\n*   **Security Breach**: Potential loss of customer data. Mitigation: Adherence to security best practices and regular audits.\\n*   **Payment Gateway Issues**: Integration problems causing transaction failures. Mitigation: Thorough testing in a sandbox environment.\\n*   **High Cart Abandonment**: A complicated checkout process could deter users. Mitigation: UX testing and optimization of the checkout flow.\\n', 'auto_focus': True, 'timestamp': '2025-11-22T22:02:45.185954'}",
