    "Of course. As the Master Orchestrator for AI-SOL, I will guide you through the creation of your To-Do List Website. Let's begin.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Current Stage**: Requirements\n\ud83d\udccb **Action**: Acknowledge the project request, confirm understanding, and initiate the requirements gathering phase.\n\ud83d\udca1 **Reasoning**: Before we design the architecture or write any code, it's crucial to establish a solid, shared understanding of the project goals. This ensures the final product aligns perfectly with your vision and helps us make key technical decisions early on.\n\u2728 **Expected Outcome**: A clear project brief, a list of detailed functional and non-functional requirements, and answers to key architectural questions that will guide the entire development process.\n\n***\n\nHello! Thank you for providing the initial requirements for the \"Basic To-Do List Website.\" I have reviewed the document and am ready to begin our collaboration.\n\n**My Understanding of Your Project:**\n\nYou envision a clean, responsive, and user-friendly web application for managing personal tasks. Key features include adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. You also want more advanced functionality like task prioritization/categorization and drag-and-drop reordering. The application needs to be fast, compatible with modern browsers, and must save user data.\n\n**Our High-Level Approach (The AI-SOL Workflow):**\n\nWe will proceed through the following stages together. I will explain each step as we go:\n1.  **Requirements**: We are here now. We will refine and detail your initial request.\n2.  **Architecture**: I will design the system, choose the technology stack, and map out the file structure.\n3.  **Implementation**: I will generate all the necessary code based on the approved architecture.\n4.  **QA**: I will create and run tests to ensure the application works as expected.\n5.  **DevOps**: I will prepare the project for deployment.\n\n**Clarifying Questions:**\n\nTo ensure we build exactly what you need, I have a few questions based on your requirements. Your answers will significantly influence the project's architecture.\n\n1.  **Data Persistence**: You mentioned \"local storage or backend database.\" This is a critical decision.\n    *   **Option A: Local Storage**. This is simpler. Tasks are saved directly in the user's browser. The data will be lost if they clear their browser cache, and tasks will not sync across different devices.\n    *   **Option B: Backend Database**. This is more complex but allows for user accounts (login/logout). Tasks would be saved to a central server and accessible from any device.\n    **Which approach do you prefer?**\n\n2.  **Task Organization**: You requested an \"option to prioritize or categorize tasks.\"\n    *   Could you clarify if you need both?\n    *   For categorization, do you envision simple text labels (e.g., \"Work,\" \"Home\") or something else?\n    *   For prioritization, would a simple \"High/Medium/Low\" system suffice?\n\n3.  **Task Reordering**: You mentioned reordering by \"drag and drop or priority.\"\n    *   Would you like users to be able to manually reorder tasks via drag-and-drop, AND also have a button to automatically sort the list by priority?\n\nPlease review my understanding and answer the questions above. Once we're aligned, I will proceed with creating the detailed requirements document for your approval.",
