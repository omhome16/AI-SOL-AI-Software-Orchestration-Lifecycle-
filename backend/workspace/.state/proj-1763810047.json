    "Excellent. I have received your request and am ready to begin the AI Software Orchestration Lifecycle (AI-SOL). My purpose is to guide you through the creation of your \"Basic To-Do List Website\" with complete transparency and collaboration.\n\nLet's start by ensuring we have a shared understanding of the project.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Current Stage**: 1. Requirements (Initiation)\n\ud83d\udccb **Action**: Acknowledge Project Request and Clarify Scope\n\ud83d\udca1 **Reasoning**: Before diving into detailed planning, it's crucial to confirm the project's core goals and resolve any major ambiguities. This ensures the foundation we build upon is solid and aligned with your vision.\n\u2728 **Expected Outcome**: A clear, mutual understanding of the project's scope and a decision on the initial technical approach, allowing us to proceed confidently to detailed requirements gathering.\n\n***\n\nHello! I have analyzed your requirements for the \"Basic To-Do List Website\". Here is my understanding of what we are about to build:\n\n*   **Core Product**: A user-friendly, responsive web application for managing personal tasks.\n*   **Key Features**: Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. They can also reorder tasks (e.g., via drag-and-drop) and potentially categorize or prioritize them.\n*   **Data Persistence**: The application must save the user's tasks so they are not lost when the page is reloaded.\n*   **Initial Tech Stack**: The front-end will be built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The method for saving data is a key decision point.\n\n**Clarifying Questions:**\n\nTo ensure we start on the right path, I need your input on one critical architectural decision mentioned in your requirements:\n\n1.  **Data Storage Method**: You mentioned \"local storage or backend database\". This choice significantly impacts the project's complexity.\n    *   **Option A: Local Storage**: We can build a client-side-only application. Tasks would be saved directly in the user's browser. This is simpler and faster to develop, but tasks will not be accessible on other devices or browsers.\n    *   **Option B: Backend with Database**: We can build a full-stack application. This would involve creating a simple API and database. It allows for future features like user accounts and syncing tasks across multiple devices.\n\nWhich approach would you prefer for this initial version? I recommend **Option A (Local Storage)** for a \"Basic\" version, as it allows us to build and launch the core functionality quickly. We can always add a backend later.\n\n2.  **Task Prioritization/Categorization**: You mentioned this as an option. For the first version, would you prefer:\n    *   **A) Simple Priority**: A high/medium/low flag for each task.\n    *   **B) User-Defined Categories**: Allowing users to create their own tags or categories (e.g., \"Work\", \"Home\").\n    *   **C) Defer for later**: Keep it simple for now and only focus on the core to-do list functionality.\n\nPlease provide your answers to these questions. Once we've clarified these points, I will be ready to move into the detailed requirements analysis.",
