Project Overview \ud83d\udcdd\\\\n\\\\nThis document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a new To-Do List web application. The primary goal is to create a clean, intuitive, and responsive single-page application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. The application will be client-side only, utilizing browser local storage for data persistence. The focus is on a high-quality user experience, accessibility, and modern web standards.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Functional Requirements \ud83d\udccb\\\\n\\\\nThe following table details the core features and user stories for the application.\\\\n\\\\n| ID | User Story / Description | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |\\\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\\\\n| FR-001 | As a user, I want to add new tasks to my to-do list so I can track my responsibilities. | **High** | - An input field is present to enter task descriptions.<br>- Clicking an \\'Add\\' button or pressing \\'Enter\\' adds the new task.<br>- The input field is cleared after a task is added. |\\\\n| FR-002 | As a user, I want to view all my tasks in a list so I can see what needs to be done. | **High** | - All added tasks are displayed in a clear, vertical list.<br>- Each task in the list shows its full description. |\\\\n| FR-003 | As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete to track my progress. | **High** | - Each task has a checkbox.<br>- Clicking the checkbox marks the task as complete with a visual change (e.g., strikethrough).<br>- Clicking again reverts the task to incomplete. |\\\\n| FR-004 | As a user, I want to edit the description of an existing task to correct or update it. | **Medium** | - An \\'Edit\\' button/icon is available for each task.<br>- Clicking \\'Edit\\' allows in-place modification of the task\\'s description.<br>- Changes are saved upon confirmation (e.g., pressing \\'Enter\\'). |\\\\n| FR-005 | As a user, I want to delete tasks that are no longer needed. | **Medium** | - A \\'Delete\\' button/icon is available for each task.<br>- Clicking \\'Delete\\' permanently removes the task from the list. |\\\\n| FR-006 | As a user, I want my tasks to be saved so I don\\'t lose them when I refresh or close the page. | **High** | - Tasks and their completion status are preserved after a browser refresh or restart.<br>- Data is stored using the browser\\'s Local Storage. |\\\\n| FR-007 | As a user, I want the website to be responsive so I can use it on both my desktop and mobile devices. | **High** | - The layout adjusts gracefully to fit various screen sizes.<br>- All functionality is accessible on smaller screens without horizontal scrolling. |\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## 3. Non-Functional Requirements \u2699\ufe0f\\\\n\\\\n### 3.1 UI/UX Design \ud83c\udfa8\\\\n\\\\nThe application\\'s design should be modern, clean, and intuitive. The user interface must be simple enough for a new user to understand and use all core features within 60 seconds without instructions.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Clarity**: All interactive elements (buttons, inputs) must be clearly identifiable.\\\\n*   **Feedback**: The system must provide immediate visual feedback for user actions like adding, completing, or deleting a task.\\\\n*   **Consistency**: The design language (colors, fonts, spacing) must be consistent throughout the application.\\\\n*   **Modern Patterns**:\\\\n    *   **In-place Editing**: Users can edit tasks directly in the list view without navigating to a new page.\\\\n    *   **Minimalist Interface**: Avoid clutter. The focus should be on the task list itself.\\\\n    *   **Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs)**: The primary action (adding a task) should be prominent.\\\\n\\\\n### 3.2 Design Mockups \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\\\\n\\\\nThis section will be updated with visual guides once they are created.\\\\n\\\\n#### Low-Fidelity Wireframes\\\\n*Placeholder for low-fidelity wireframes showing basic layout and element placement for mobile and desktop views.*\", \\'![Low-Fidelity Wireframe](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Low-Fidelity+Wireframe)\\', \\'\\\\n\\\\n#### High-Fidelity Mockups\\\\n*Placeholder for high-fidelity mockups showing the final visual design, including color palette, typography, and iconography.*\\', \\'![High-Fidelity Mockup](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=High-Fidelity+Mockup)\\', \\'\\\\n\\\\n### 3.3 Responsive Layouts \ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcbb\\\\n\\\\nThe application must provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices.\\\\n\\\\n| Device Class | Viewport Width | Layout Requirements |\\\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\\\\n| **Mobile** | < 768px | - Single-column layout.<br>- Touch-friendly button sizes.<br>- Legible font sizes. |\\\\n| **Tablet** | 768px - 1024px | - Single or two-column layout.<br>- Optimized spacing for a wider view. |\\\\n| **Desktop** | > 1024px | - Centered, fixed-width container for the main content.<br>- Utilizes whitespace effectively. |\\\\n\\\\n### 3.4 Browser Compatibility \ud83c\udf10\\\\n\\\\nThe application must be fully functional and render correctly on the latest two versions of all major web browsers.\\\\n\\\\n*   \u2705 Google Chrome\\\\n*   \u2705 Mozilla Firefox\\\\n*   \u2705 Microsoft Edge\\\\n*   \u2705 Apple Safari\\\\n\\\\n### 3.5 Accessibility (A11y) \u267f\\\\n\\\\nThe application must be accessible to people with disabilities and conform to **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML5 tags (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<button>`, etc.) to define the page structure.\\\\n*   **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements must be focusable and operable using only a keyboard. The focus order must be logical.\\\\n*   **Screen Reader Support**: Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where necessary to provide context to screen reader users (e.g., `aria-label` for icon-only buttons).\\\\n*   **Color Contrast**: Text and background colors must meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1.\\\\n*   **Alt Text**: All meaningful images must have descriptive alternative text.\\\\n\\\\n### 3.6 Search Engine Optimization (SEO) \ud83d\udcc8\\\\n\\\\nBasic on-page SEO principles will be implemented to ensure the site is indexable and discoverable.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Title Tag**: The `<title>` tag will be descriptive and relevant (e.g., \"My To-Do List | A Simple Task Manager\").\\\\n*   **Meta Description**: A concise and relevant meta description will be provided.\\\\n*   **Semantic Markup**: Use of header tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to create a logical document outline.\\\\n\\\\n### 3.7 Performance \ud83d\ude80\\\\n\\\\nThe application must be fast and responsive to user input.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Initial Page Load**: The page should be interactive in **under 2 seconds** on a standard 4G connection.\\\\n*   **UI Responsiveness**: All user actions (add, complete, delete) should provide feedback in **under 200ms**.\\\\n*   **Asset Optimization**: CSS and JavaScript files will be minified to reduce file size.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## 4. Technical Specifications & Scope\\\\n\\\\n### 4.1 Recommended Tech Stack\\\\n\\\\n| Category | Technology |\\\\n| :--- | :--- |\\\\n| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+) |\\\\n| **Database** | Browser Local Storage |\\\\n| **DevOps** | Git, GitHub, Netlify/Vercel for deployment |\\\\n\\\\n### 4.2 Assumptions\\\\n\\\\n*   The application is for single-user, client-side use only.\\\\n*   No user authentication or cloud synchronization is required for this version.\\\\n*   The visual design will prioritize simplicity and functionality.\\\\n\\\\n### 4.3 Risks\\\\n\\\\n| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |\\\\n| :--- | :--- |\\\\n| **Data Loss** | Since data is in local storage, users will lose tasks if they clear their browser cache. This limitation will be communicated to the user. |\\\\n| **Scope Creep** | Requests for features like user accounts or cloud sync will be deferred to a future version (v2.0). |\\\\n| **Browser Inconsistencies** | Rigorous testing across all target browsers will be conducted to identify and fix any CSS or JavaScript compatibility issues. |\\\\n\\\\n### 4.4 Estimated Timeline\\\\n\\\\n*   **Total Estimated Effort**: 20-30 hours\\']\\n', 'auto_focus': True, 'timestamp': '2025-11-23T00:28:57.440699'}",

The architecture consists of a React/TypeScript frontend and a Node.js/TypeScript backend, ensuring type-safety and maintainability. The backend follows a layered, service-oriented pattern (Controllers, Services, Repositories) with Express.js, making it scalable and easy to maintain. Data persistence is handled by a PostgreSQL database accessed via the Prisma ORM for type-safe queries. The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and Vite, utilizing a component-based architecture with a feature-sliced organization. Communication is handled via a RESTful API, with security implemented through JWT-based authentication.

Project Overview \ud83d\udcdd\\n\\nThis document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a new To-Do List web application. The primary goal is to create a clean, intuitive, and responsive single-page application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. The application will be client-side only, utilizing browser local storage for data persistence. The focus is on a high-quality user experience, accessibility, and modern web standards.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Functional Requirements \ud83d\udccb\\n\\nThe following table details the core features and user stories for the application.\\n\\n| ID | User Story / Description | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| FR-001 | As a user, I want to add new tasks to my to-do list so I can track my responsibilities. | **High** | - An input field is present to enter task descriptions.<br>- Clicking an 'Add' button or pressing 'Enter' adds the new task.<br>- The input field is cleared after a task is added. |\\n| FR-002 | As a user, I want to view all my tasks in a list so I can see what needs to be done. | **High** | - All added tasks are displayed in a clear, vertical list.<br>- Each task in the list shows its full description. |\\n| FR-003 | As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete to track my progress. | **High** | - Each task has a checkbox.<br>- Clicking the checkbox marks the task as complete with a visual change (e.g., strikethrough).<br>- Clicking again reverts the task to incomplete. |\\n| FR-004 | As a user, I want to edit the description of an existing task to correct or update it. | **Medium** | - An 'Edit' button/icon is available for each task.<br>- Clicking 'Edit' allows in-place modification of the task's description.<br>- Changes are saved upon confirmation (e.g., pressing 'Enter'). |\\n| FR-005 | As a user, I want to delete tasks that are no longer needed. | **Medium** | - A 'Delete' button/icon is available for each task.<br>- Clicking 'Delete' permanently removes the task from the list. |\\n| FR-006 | As a user, I want my tasks to be saved so I don't lose them when I refresh or close the page. | **High** | - Tasks and their completion status are preserved after a browser refresh or restart.<br>- Data is stored using the browser's Local Storage. |\\n| FR-007 | As a user, I want the website to be responsive so I can use it on both my desktop and mobile devices. | **High** | - The layout adjusts gracefully to fit various screen sizes.<br>- All functionality is accessible on smaller screens without horizontal scrolling. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Non-Functional Requirements \u2699\ufe0f\\n\\n### 3.1 UI/UX Design \ud83c\udfa8\\n\\nThe application's design should be modern, clean, and intuitive. The user interface must be simple enough for a new user to understand and use all core features within 60 seconds without instructions.\\n\\n*   **Clarity**: All interactive elements (buttons, inputs) must be clearly identifiable.\\n*   **Feedback**: The system must provide immediate visual feedback for user actions like adding, completing, or deleting a task.\\n*   **Consistency**: The design language (colors, fonts, spacing) must be consistent throughout the application.\\n*   **Modern Patterns**:\\n    *   **In-place Editing**: Users can edit tasks directly in the list view without navigating to a new page.\\n    *   **Minimalist Interface**: Avoid clutter. The focus should be on the task list itself.\\n    *   **Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs)**: The primary action (adding a task) should be prominent.\\n\\n### 3.2 Design Mockups \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\\n\\nThis section will be updated with visual guides once they are created.\\n\\n#### Low-Fidelity Wireframes\\n*Placeholder for low-fidelity wireframes showing basic layout and element placement for mobile and desktop views.*\", '![Low-Fidelity Wireframe](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Low-Fidelity+Wireframe)', '\\n\\n#### High-Fidelity Mockups\\n*Placeholder for high-fidelity mockups showing the final visual design, including color palette, typography, and iconography.*', '![High-Fidelity Mockup](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=High-Fidelity+Mockup)', '\\n\\n### 3.3 Responsive Layouts \ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcbb\\n\\nThe application must provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices.\\n\\n| Device Class | Viewport Width | Layout Requirements |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| **Mobile** | < 768px | - Single-column layout.<br>- Touch-friendly button sizes.<br>- Legible font sizes. |\\n| **Tablet** | 768px - 1024px | - Single or two-column layout.<br>- Optimized spacing for a wider view. |\\n| **Desktop** | > 1024px | - Centered, fixed-width container for the main content.<br>- Utilizes whitespace effectively. |\\n\\n### 3.4 Browser Compatibility \ud83c\udf10\\n\\nThe application must be fully functional and render correctly on the latest two versions of all major web browsers.\\n\\n*   \u2705 Google Chrome\\n*   \u2705 Mozilla Firefox\\n*   \u2705 Microsoft Edge\\n*   \u2705 Apple Safari\\n\\n### 3.5 Accessibility (A11y) \u267f\\n\\nThe application must be accessible to people with disabilities and conform to **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**.\\n\\n*   **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML5 tags (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<button>`, etc.) to define the page structure.\\n*   **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements must be focusable and operable using only a keyboard. The focus order must be logical.\\n*   **Screen Reader Support**: Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where necessary to provide context to screen reader users (e.g., `aria-label` for icon-only buttons).\\n*   **Color Contrast**: Text and background colors must meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1.\\n*   **Alt Text**: All meaningful images must have descriptive alternative text.\\n\\n### 3.6 Search Engine Optimization (SEO) \ud83d\udcc8\\n\\nBasic on-page SEO principles will be implemented to ensure the site is indexable and discoverable.\\n\\n*   **Title Tag**: The `<title>` tag will be descriptive and relevant (e.g., \"My To-Do List | A Simple Task Manager\").\\n*   **Meta Description**: A concise and relevant meta description will be provided.\\n*   **Semantic Markup**: Use of header tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to create a logical document outline.\\n\\n### 3.7 Performance \ud83d\ude80\\n\\nThe application must be fast and responsive to user input.\\n\\n*   **Initial Page Load**: The page should be interactive in **under 2 seconds** on a standard 4G connection.\\n*   **UI Responsiveness**: All user actions (add, complete, delete) should provide feedback in **under 200ms**.\\n*   **Asset Optimization**: CSS and JavaScript files will be minified to reduce file size.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Technical Specifications & Scope\\n\\n### 4.1 Recommended Tech Stack\\n\\n| Category | Technology |\\n| :--- | :--- |\\n| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+) |\\n| **Database** | Browser Local Storage |\\n| **DevOps** | Git, GitHub, Netlify/Vercel for deployment |\\n\\n### 4.2 Assumptions\\n\\n*   The application is for single-user, client-side use only.\\n*   No user authentication or cloud synchronization is required for this version.\\n*   The visual design will prioritize simplicity and functionality.\\n\\n### 4.3 Risks\\n\\n| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |\\n| :--- | :--- |\\n| **Data Loss** | Since data is in local storage, users will lose tasks if they clear their browser cache. This limitation will be communicated to the user. |\\n| **Scope Creep** | Requests for features like user accounts or cloud sync will be deferred to a future version (v2.0). |\\n| **Browser Inconsistencies** | Rigorous testing across all target browsers will be conducted to identify and fix any CSS or JavaScript compatibility issues. |\\n\\n### 4.4 Estimated Timeline\\n\\n*   **Total Estimated Effort**: 20-30 hours']\n",
