UI/UX Design & Non-Functional Requirements\\n\\nThis section covers the quality attributes of the system, focusing on user experience, performance, and accessibility.\\n\\n### 3.1. UI/UX & Modern Web Patterns\\nThe user interface should be clean, minimalist, and intuitive. The design will follow modern web patterns to ensure a high-quality user experience.\\n\\n*   **Intuitive Interface**: A new user should be able to add, complete, and delete a task within 60 seconds without instructions.\\n*   **Visual Feedback**: The application must provide immediate visual feedback for user actions like adding, completing, or deleting a task (e.g., subtle animations).\\n*   **Single Page Application (SPA)**: The app will operate as an SPA, meaning no full-page reloads are required for core actions, providing a faster, more fluid experience.\\n*   **Optimistic UI Updates**: UI will update instantly upon user action, assuming success. This makes the app feel extremely responsive.\\n\\n### 3.2. Design Mockups\\n*(This section will be populated with visual mockups and wireframes from the design phase.)*\\n\\n#### Low-Fidelity Wireframe (Mobile & Desktop)\\n*Placeholder for initial layout sketches showing the task input field, task list, and action buttons for both mobile and desktop views.*\\n\\n#### High-Fidelity Mockup (Desktop)\\n*Placeholder for a detailed, full-color design mockup of the desktop interface, including typography, color palette, and iconography.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcf1 4. Responsiveness & Compatibility\\n\\n### 4.1. Responsive Layouts\\nThe application must provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices.\\n\\n| Device Type | Viewport Width | Requirements |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| **Mobile** | 320px - 767px | Single-column layout. Tappable elements must have a minimum size of 44x44 pixels. Font sizes must be legible. |\\n| **Tablet** | 768px - 1024px | Layout may adapt to a wider single column or a two-column view if applicable. |\\n| **Desktop** | 1025px+ | Centered, fixed-width layout. Optimized for mouse and keyboard interaction. |\\n\\n### 4.2. Browser Compatibility\\nThe application must be fully functional and visually consistent on the latest two versions of all major web browsers.\\n\\n*   \u2705 Google Chrome\\n*   \u2705 Mozilla Firefox\\n*   \u2705 Apple Safari\\n*   \u2705 Microsoft Edge\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \u267f 5. Accessibility (A11Y) & SEO\\n\\n### 5.1. Accessibility\\nThe application must be compliant with **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards to ensure it is usable by people with disabilities.\\n\\n*   **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements (inputs, buttons, checkboxes) must be focusable and operable using only a keyboard.\\n*   **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML5 elements (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<button>`, etc.) to define the structure and meaning of the content.\\n*   **ARIA Roles**: Use appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles where necessary to enhance screen reader compatibility (e.g., for status updates).\\n*   **Color Contrast**: Text and background colors must meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1.\\n*   **Labels**: All form controls must have associated `<label>` elements.\\n\\n### 5.2. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)\\nBasic on-page SEO principles will be implemented.\\n\\n*   **Title Tag**: The `<title>` tag will be descriptive and relevant (e.g., \"My To-Do List | A Simple & Fast Task Manager\").\\n*   **Meta Description**: A concise and compelling meta description will be provided.\\n*   **Clean URL**: The application will be served from a clean, user-friendly URL.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcbb 6. Technical Specifications\\n\\n### 6.1. Recommended Technology Stack\\n\\n| Category | Technology | Notes |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+) | No framework required for this simple version, but Vue or React are options for future expansion. |\\n| **Backend** | None | The application is fully client-side. A Node.js/Express backend could be added later for user accounts. |\\n| **Database** | Browser Local Storage | For client-side data persistence. |\\n| **DevOps** | Git, GitHub/GitLab | For version control. |\\n| **Hosting** | Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages | For easy, continuous deployment of the static site. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f 7. Project Scope & Timeline\\n\\n### 7.1. Estimated Timeline\\n*   **Total Estimated Time**: **1-2 weeks** (approx. 20-40 hours for a single developer).\\n\\n### 7.2. Assumptions\\n*   The initial version will **not** require user authentication or a backend server.\\n*   The application is for personal use; no collaboration features are in scope.\\n*   The design will be simple and functional, prioritizing usability.\\n\\n### 7.3. \u26a0\ufe0f Risks & Mitigation\\n\\n| Risk | Description | Mitigation Strategy |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| **Data Loss** | Users will lose all data if they clear their browser cache, as data is stored in Local Storage. | Display a clear, non-intrusive message in the UI explaining that data is stored locally and can be lost. |\\n| **Scope Creep** | Requests for features like cloud sync or user accounts would significantly increase complexity. | Adhere strictly to the defined requirements for Version 1.0. Log new feature requests for future consideration. |\\n| **Browser Incompatibility** | Minor differences in CSS or JS across browsers could cause visual or functional bugs. | Conduct thorough cross-browser testing on all target browsers before release. |\\n', 'auto_focus': True, 'timestamp': '2025-11-23T00:55:27.156228'}",

Modern Web Patterns & Technology Stack\\n\\nThe project will leverage a modern technology stack and architecture to ensure scalability, performance, and a high-quality developer experience.\\n\\n### 5.1. Architecture Overview\\nThe application uses a **decoupled architecture** with a separate frontend (Single-Page Application) and backend (RESTful API). This allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of the client and server. The backend follows a **service-oriented, modular monolith** pattern, which provides clear separation of concerns and simplifies future migration to microservices if needed.\\n\\n### 5.2. Technology Stack\\n\\n| Component | Technology / Library | Purpose |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| **Frontend** | React (with Vite) | Building a fast, component-based user interface. |\\n| | React Router | For client-side routing and navigation. |\\n| | Axios | For making HTTP requests to the backend API. |\\n| | CSS Modules / Tailwind | For scoped, maintainable styling. |\\n| **Backend** | Node.js / Express | Building a robust and scalable REST API. |\\n| **Database** | PostgreSQL | A powerful, open-source relational database. |\\n| | Prisma | A next-generation ORM for type-safe database access. |\\n| **Authentication** | JSON Web Tokens (JWT) | For secure, stateless authentication. |\\n\\n### 5.3. Key Development Patterns\\n*   **Component-Based UI:** The frontend will be built as a collection of reusable, encapsulated components.\\n*   **Centralized State Management:** React Context will be used for managing global state like user authentication.\\n*   **API Service Layer:** A dedicated layer in the frontend will handle all communication with the backend API, abstracting away the data-fetching logic.\\n*   **Environment Variables:** Centralized configuration for both frontend and backend to manage environment-specific settings (e.g., API URLs, database connections).\\n', 'auto_focus': True, 'timestamp': '2025-11-23T00:58:24.901617'}",

Modern Web Patterns & Technology Stack\n\nThe project will leverage a modern technology stack and architecture to ensure scalability, performance, and a high-quality developer experience.\n\n### 5.1. Architecture Overview\nThe application uses a **decoupled architecture** with a separate frontend (Single-Page Application) and backend (RESTful API). This allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of the client and server. The backend follows a **service-oriented, modular monolith** pattern, which provides clear separation of concerns and simplifies future migration to microservices if needed.\n\n### 5.2. Technology Stack\n\n| Component | Technology / Library | Purpose |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Frontend** | React (with Vite) | Building a fast, component-based user interface. |\n| | React Router | For client-side routing and navigation. |\n| | Axios | For making HTTP requests to the backend API. |\n| | CSS Modules / Tailwind | For scoped, maintainable styling. |\n| **Backend** | Node.js / Express | Building a robust and scalable REST API. |\n| **Database** | PostgreSQL | A powerful, open-source relational database. |\n| | Prisma | A next-generation ORM for type-safe database access. |\n| **Authentication** | JSON Web Tokens (JWT) | For secure, stateless authentication. |\n\n### 5.3. Key Development Patterns\n*   **Component-Based UI:** The frontend will be built as a collection of reusable, encapsulated components.\n*   **Centralized State Management:** React Context will be used for managing global state like user authentication.\n*   **API Service Layer:** A dedicated layer in the frontend will handle all communication with the backend API, abstracting away the data-fetching logic.\n*   **Environment Variables:** Centralized configuration for both frontend and backend to manage environment-specific settings (e.g., API URLs, database connections).\n",
